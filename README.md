# nwn-logparser
External combat log parser for the game Neverwinter Nights, written in Java.

## Background
I first started on this parser back in 2010 duing my first year of university to apply the skills and tools I learned on a personal application. It motivated me to learn beyond the scope of my classes and provided a playground where I knew all the ins and outs of the application. When I later learned about code structure, patterns, and clean coding, I came to realize the horrible state the project was in.

It has now been years since I last did any work on the project. I have been thinking of opensourcing it for some time now, but for that to be any useful the code has to be cleaned.

This is currently a project where I try to apply the teachings of Robert C. Martin as I go through his book Clean Code.
